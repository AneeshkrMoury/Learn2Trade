    'tutorial_1_title': "What is the Stock Market?",
    'tutorial_1_desc': "An introduction to the stock market, its purpose, and basic functions.",
    'tutorial_1_exp_1': "The stock market is a global network where people buy and sell ownership stakes (called shares or stocks) in publicly listed companies.",
    'tutorial_1_exp_2': "It's where businesses raise money to grow, and where investors try to make their money grow by becoming part-owners.",
    'tutorial_1_ana_1': "Think of it like a very big auction house. Companies put up small pieces of themselves for sale. You, as an investor, can bid on those pieces.",
    'tutorial_1_ana_2': "If the company does well, your piece becomes more valuable, and you can sell it for more than you paid.",
    'tutorial_1_tak_1': "It's a place to buy and sell ownership in companies.",
    'tutorial_1_tak_2': "Companies use it to raise funds for expansion.",
    'tutorial_1_tak_3': "Investors use it to potentially grow their wealth.",

    'tutorial_2_title': "What is a Share/Stock?",
    'tutorial_2_desc': "Understand what a share represents and what it means to be a shareholder.",
    'tutorial_2_exp_1': "A share, or stock, is a certificate that represents a small fraction of ownership in a company.",
    'tutorial_2_exp_2': "When you own a share, you are a 'shareholder,' and you have a claim on a portion of the company's assets and earnings.",
    'tutorial_2_ana_1': "Imagine a company is a large pizza. A share is like one slice of that pizza.",
    'tutorial_2_ana_2': "If you own a slice, you own part of the pizza. If the pizza becomes more popular and valuable, so does your slice.",
    'tutorial_2_tak_1': "A share is a unit of ownership in a company.",
    'tutorial_2_tak_2': "Owning shares makes you a part-owner (a shareholder).",
    'tutorial_2_tak_3': "The value of your share can change based on the company's performance.",

    'tutorial_3_title': "Why Companies Issue Shares?",
    'tutorial_3_desc': "Learn the primary reasons businesses choose to 'go public' and sell stock.",
    'tutorial_3_exp_1': "Companies issue shares primarily to raise money, also known as capital.",
    'tutorial_3_exp_2': "This money can be used for various purposes like funding expansion, launching new products, paying off debt, or hiring more employees, without having to take out a loan from a bank.",
    'tutorial_3_ana_1': "Imagine you have a brilliant idea for a lemonade stand that you want to turn into a nationwide chain. You need a lot of money to build new stands.",
    'tutorial_3_ana_2': "Instead of borrowing, you sell small ownership stakes to your friends and family. They give you money now, hoping that as your business grows, their small stake will become much more valuable.",
    'tutorial_3_tak_1': "The main reason is to raise capital for growth and operations.",
    'tutorial_3_tak_2': "It's an alternative to borrowing money from a bank.",
    'tutorial_3_tak_3': "Selling shares allows a company to share both its risks and its potential profits with a wide range of investors.",

    'tutorial_4_title': "How the Stock Market Works",
    'tutorial_4_desc': "Get a high-level overview of the process of buying and selling stocks.",
    'tutorial_4_exp_1': "The market works like a continuous auction. Buyers state the highest price they're willing to pay for a stock (the 'bid'), and sellers state the lowest price they're willing to accept (the 'ask').",
    'tutorial_4_exp_2': "When a bid and an ask price match, a trade is executed. This all happens electronically through platforms called stock exchanges.",
    'tutorial_4_ana_1': "It's like an online marketplace (like eBay). A seller lists a collectible for $10 ('ask'). Many buyers are interested, but the highest offer is $9 ('bid'). No sale happens.",
    'tutorial_4_ana_2': "Finally, a buyer agrees to the $10 price, or the seller lowers their price to $9. The moment they agree, the transaction happens instantly. The stock market does this millions of times per second for thousands of companies.",
    'tutorial_4_tak_1': "It matches buyers and sellers of stocks.",
    'tutorial_4_tak_2': "Transactions occur when the 'bid' price meets the 'ask' price.",
    'tutorial_4_tak_3': "Modern markets are electronic, fast, and highly regulated.",

    'tutorial_5_title': "Primary Market vs. Secondary Market",
    'tutorial_5_desc': "Understand the two main stages where stock transactions occur.",
    'tutorial_5_exp_1': "The Primary Market is where a company sells its shares directly to investors for the very first time. This is the IPO (Initial Public Offering) stage. The money from this sale goes to the company.",
    'tutorial_5_exp_2': "The Secondary Market is what we usually refer to as 'the stock market.' It's where investors buy and sell shares from each other. The company is not directly involved in these transactions.",
    'tutorial_5_ana_1': "Think of a car manufacturer. The Primary Market is like buying a brand-new car directly from the factory's showroom. The money goes straight to the manufacturer.",
    'tutorial_5_ana_2': "The Secondary Market is like the used car market. People who bought the new cars now sell them to other people. The manufacturer doesn't get any money from these sales.",
    'tutorial_5_tak_1': "Primary Market = Company sells to investors (e.g., IPO).",
    'tutorial_5_tak_2': "Secondary Market = Investors sell to other investors.",
    'tutorial_5_tak_3': "Most daily trading happens in the Secondary Market.",

    'tutorial_6_title': "What is an IPO (Initial Public Offering)?",
    'tutorial_6_desc': "Learn about the process of a private company becoming publicly traded.",
    'tutorial_6_exp_1': "An IPO is the event where a private company first makes its shares available for purchase by the general public.",
    'tutorial_6_exp_2': "This transition is often called 'going public.' It's a major step for a company, allowing it to raise a lot of capital but also subjecting it to stricter regulations and public scrutiny.",
    'tutorial_6_ana_1': "Imagine a talented local baker who is famous in their town. An IPO is like that baker deciding to franchise their business and sell the rights to open their bakeries across the country.",
    'tutorial_6_ana_2': "It's the very first time anyone outside of the original family can own a piece of the bakery business.",
    'tutorial_6_tak_1': "An IPO is a company's first sale of stock to the public.",
    'tutorial_6_tak_2': "It's how a private company becomes a public company.",
    'tutorial_6_tak_3': "It's a significant fundraising event for the company.",

    'tutorial_7_title': "How Investors Earn Money",
    'tutorial_7_desc': "Discover the two primary ways to profit from owning stocks.",
    'tutorial_7_exp_1': "Investors primarily make money in two ways: Capital Gains and Dividends.",
    'tutorial_7_exp_2': "Capital Gains occur when you sell a stock for a higher price than you paid for it. Dividends are periodic payments made by a company to its shareholders, usually from its profits.",
    'tutorial_7_ana_1': "Think of owning a rental property. You can earn money in two ways:",
    'tutorial_7_ana_2': "1. Capital Gains: You buy the house for ₹10 Lakhs and sell it five years later for ₹15 Lakhs. Your capital gain is ₹5 Lakhs.",
    'tutorial_7_ana_3': "2. Dividends: While you own the house, you rent it out. The monthly rent you collect is like a dividend - a regular income from your asset.",
    'tutorial_7_tak_1': "Capital Gains = Selling a stock for more than you bought it for.",
    'tutorial_7_tak_2': "Dividends = Receiving a share of the company's profits.",
    'tutorial_7_tak_3': "Not all companies pay dividends; many reinvest profits to grow.",

    'tutorial_8_title': "Dividends Explained",
    'tutorial_8_desc': "A closer look at how companies share profits with their owners.",
    'tutorial_8_exp_1': "A dividend is a distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders. It's decided by the company's board of directors.",
    'tutorial_8_exp_2': "Dividends are often a sign of a company's financial health and stability. They are typically paid quarterly and can be taken as cash or reinvested to buy more shares.",
    'tutorial_8_ana_1': "Imagine you co-own a successful coffee shop with friends. At the end of the year, you have a pile of profits. The group decides to distribute some of that profit among all the owners.",
    'tutorial_8_ana_2': "That payout is a dividend. The group might also decide to keep some money to buy a new espresso machine (this is called 'retained earnings').",
    'tutorial_8_tak_1': "Dividends are a way for companies to share profits with shareholders.",
    'tutorial_8_tak_2': "They are common among mature, stable companies.",
    'tutorial_8_tak_3': "Receiving dividends is a form of investment income.",

    'tutorial_9_title': "Capital Gains Explained",
    'tutorial_9_desc': "Understanding the profit made from a stock's price increase.",
    'tutorial_9_exp_1': "A capital gain is the profit you realize when you sell an asset, like a stock, for more than your original purchase price.",
    'tutorial_9_exp_2': "If you buy a share for ₹100 and sell it for ₹150, you have a capital gain of ₹50. This gain is 'realized' only when you sell. If you don't sell, it's an 'unrealized' gain.",
    'tutorial_9_ana_1': "It's like buying a rare collectible for ₹1,000. Over the years, it becomes more sought after. A dealer offers you ₹5,000 for it. If you sell it, you've made a ₹4,000 capital gain.",
    'tutorial_9_ana_2': "If you just hold onto it, its value might be ₹5,000, but you haven't actually made the money yet - it's an unrealized gain.",
    'tutorial_9_tak_1': "Profit from selling a stock at a higher price.",
    'tutorial_9_tak_2': "The gain is only 'realized' (and taxable) when you sell.",
    'tutorial_9_tak_3': "The primary goal of most growth-focused investing is to achieve capital gains.",

    'tutorial_10_title': "Where Are Stocks Traded?",
    'tutorial_10_desc': "Learn about the marketplaces where stock trading takes place.",
    'tutorial_10_exp_1': "Stocks are traded on regulated marketplaces called stock exchanges.",
    'tutorial_10_exp_2': "These exchanges provide the infrastructure and framework to ensure trading is fair, orderly, and efficient. They are the central nervous system of the stock market.",
    'tutorial_10_ana_1': "Think of a farmers' market. It's a specific, organized place where farmers (sellers) and shoppers (buyers) come together to trade goods (stocks).",
    'tutorial_10_ana_2': "The market management ensures the stalls are set up correctly and that rules are followed, just like an exchange ensures fair trading.",
    'tutorial_10_tak_1': "The primary venue for stock trading is a stock exchange.",
    'tutorial_10_tak_2': "Exchanges provide a regulated and organized environment.",
    'tutorial_10_tak_3': "They are critical for ensuring trust and transparency in the market.",

    'tutorial_11_title': "Stock Exchanges (NSE, BSE, NYSE, NASDAQ)",
    'tutorial_11_desc': "Get to know some of the most famous stock exchanges in the world.",
    'tutorial_11_exp_1': "Different countries have their own major stock exchanges. For example, India has the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The USA has the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ.",
    'tutorial_11_exp_2': "The NYSE is known for its physical trading floor and listing large, established companies, while NASDAQ is a fully electronic exchange known for technology companies.",
    'tutorial_11_ana_1': "Think of them as different supermarket chains. Some, like a premium store (NYSE), are known for established, big brands. Others, like a tech-focused online grocer (NASDAQ), specialize in newer, innovative products.",
    'tutorial_11_ana_2': "You can buy groceries at any of them, but they have different characteristics and list different types of products (companies).",
    'tutorial_11_tak_1': "Major exchanges include NSE/BSE (India) and NYSE/NASDAQ (USA).",
    'tutorial_11_tak_2': "Each exchange has its own listing requirements and characteristics.",
    'tutorial_11_tak_3': "The choice of exchange is made by the company going public.",

    'tutorial_12_title': "Who Helps You Buy/Sell? (Brokers & Demat Accounts)",
    'tutorial_12_desc': "Understand the role of intermediaries that connect you to the market.",
    'tutorial_12_exp_1': "You can't just walk onto a stock exchange and buy shares. You need a licensed intermediary called a stockbroker. The broker executes trades on your behalf.",
    'tutorial_12_exp_2': "To hold your shares electronically, you need a special account called a Demat (Dematerialized) account. It's like a bank account, but it holds your shares instead of money.",
    'tutorial_12_ana_1': "A stockbroker is like a real estate agent. If you want to buy a house, you hire an agent who has access to the housing market (the exchange) and handles the paperwork.",
    'tutorial_12_ana_2': "Your Demat account is like the official deed registry. It's the secure, official place where your ownership of the house (shares) is recorded.",
    'tutorial_12_tak_1': "A stockbroker is your gateway to the stock exchange.",
    'tutorial_12_tak_2': "A Demat account is necessary to store your shares electronically and securely.",
    'tutorial_12_tak_3': "Modern brokers offer easy-to-use online platforms and mobile apps.",

    'tutorial_13_title': "What Decides Stock Prices?",
    'tutorial_13_desc': "A high-level look at the forces that move stock prices.",
    'tutorial_13_exp_1': "At its core, a stock's price is determined by the law of supply and demand.",
    'tutorial_13_exp_2': "If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), the price goes up. If more people want to sell than buy, the price goes down. Many factors influence this balance.",
    'tutorial_13_ana_1': "Think of tickets for a championship cricket match. There's a limited number of seats (supply). If the game is highly anticipated, many fans will want to buy tickets (high demand), driving the price way up.",
    'tutorial_13_ana_2': "If it's a practice match, demand is low, and ticket prices will be cheap.",
    'tutorial_13_tak_1': "Supply and demand are the fundamental drivers of stock prices.",
    'tutorial_13_tak_2': "Price reflects the collective opinion of all market participants.",
    'tutorial_13_tak_3': "The key is understanding what factors influence that supply and demand.",

    'tutorial_14_title': "Demand and Supply in the Market",
    'tutorial_14_desc': "Dive deeper into the core principle that sets all prices.",
    'tutorial_14_exp_1': "Supply refers to the number of shares available for sale at any given time. Demand refers to the number of shares investors want to buy.",
    'tutorial_14_exp_2': "Positive news about a company increases demand, while negative news increases supply (as people rush to sell). A company buying back its own shares reduces supply, which can increase the price.",
    'tutorial_14_ana_1': "Imagine a limited edition sneaker is released (fixed supply). A famous celebrity is seen wearing them (demand skyrockets), and the resale price shoots up.",
    'tutorial_14_ana_2': "Later, a rumor spreads that the sneaker has a design flaw (demand plummets, and owners try to sell), causing the price to crash.",
    'tutorial_14_tak_1': "High demand and low supply lead to price increases.",
    'tutorial_14_tak_2': "Low demand and high supply lead to price decreases.",
    'tutorial_14_tak_3': "News, events, and company actions all shift the supply-demand curve.",

    'tutorial_15_title': "Role of Company Performance",
    'tutorial_15_desc': "How a company's health and profits affect its stock price.",
    'tutorial_15_exp_1': "A company's financial health is a major driver of its stock price. Key factors include its revenue, earnings (profit), debt levels, and future growth prospects.",
    'tutorial_15_exp_2': "When a company reports strong earnings or announces an innovative new product, investors become more optimistic, demand for the stock increases, and the price rises.",
    'tutorial_15_ana_1': "Think of a student's report card. If the student consistently gets straight A's and wins awards (strong earnings reports), their reputation grows, and more top colleges will want to accept them (investor demand).",
    'tutorial_15_ana_2': "If their grades suddenly drop, colleges may lose interest, reducing their future opportunities (falling stock price).",
    'tutorial_15_tak_1': "Strong profits and revenue growth generally lead to higher stock prices.",
    'tutorial_15_tak_2': "Poor performance or a negative outlook can cause prices to fall.",
    'tutorial_15_tak_3': "Investors constantly analyze company performance to predict future value.",

    'tutorial_16_title': "Role of Economic and Global Events",
    'tutorial_16_desc': "Understand how the bigger picture impacts the stock market.",
    'tutorial_16_exp_1': "The stock market doesn't exist in a vacuum. Broader factors like the overall health of the economy, interest rates, inflation, government policies, and major global events can affect all stocks.",
    'tutorial_16_exp_2': "For example, a strong economy boosts consumer spending, which is good for most companies. A global pandemic, on the other hand, can create widespread uncertainty and cause markets to fall.",
    'tutorial_16_ana_1': "Imagine all the boats in a harbor are individual stocks. The overall water level in the harbor is the economy.",
    'tutorial_16_ana_2': "When the tide is high (a strong economy), most boats rise with it, regardless of how well-built they are. When the tide goes out (a recession), most boats will be lowered.",
    'tutorial_16_tak_1': "A rising tide lifts all boats: a good economy is generally good for the market.",
    'tutorial_16_tak_2': "Interest rates, inflation, and political events create market-wide risks and opportunities.",
    'tutorial_16_tak_3': "It's important to be aware of the macroeconomic climate.",

    'tutorial_17_title': "Types of Investors",
    'tutorial_17_desc': "Learn about the different categories of people and entities in the market.",
    'tutorial_17_exp_1': "Investors are broadly categorized based on their goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. The two main groups are retail investors and institutional investors.",
    'tutorial_17_exp_2': "Within these groups, people might identify as traders (short-term) or investors (long-term), and as growth, value, or income investors.",
    'tutorial_17_ana_1': "Think of shoppers at a grocery store. Some are doing a quick daily run for bread and milk (traders). Others are doing a big monthly shop, planning meals for weeks (long-term investors).",
    'tutorial_17_ana_2': "Some shoppers only buy organic, high-end products (growth investors), while others meticulously look for discounts and bargains (value investors).",
    'tutorial_17_tak_1': "Market participants have diverse goals and strategies.",
    'tutorial_17_tak_2': "The main distinction is between individual (retail) and large (institutional) investors.",
    'tutorial_17_tak_3': "Understanding your own investor type is a key first step.",

    'tutorial_18_title': "Traders vs. Long-term Investors",
    'tutorial_18_desc': "Distinguish between short-term speculation and long-term wealth building.",
    'tutorial_18_exp_1': "Traders aim to profit from short-term price movements, holding stocks for days, hours, or even minutes. They rely heavily on technical analysis and market sentiment.",
    'tutorial_18_exp_2': "Long-term investors aim to build wealth gradually over years or decades. They focus on a company's fundamental strength and are less concerned with daily price swings.",
    'tutorial_18_ana_1': "A trader is like a surfer, trying to catch and ride short, powerful waves (price trends) for a quick thrill.",
    'tutorial_18_ana_2': "A long-term investor is like the captain of a large ship, charting a course across the ocean. They know there will be storms (volatility), but they are focused on reaching a distant destination (retirement, wealth goals).",
    'tutorial_18_tak_1': "Trading is about timing the market; investing is about time IN the market.",
    'tutorial_18_tak_2': "Trading is generally higher risk and requires more active attention.",
    'tutorial_18_tak_3': "Long-term investing is a proven strategy for building wealth over time.",

    'tutorial_19_title': "Institutional Investors vs. Retail Investors",
    'tutorial_19_desc': "Understand the difference between the big players and individual investors.",
    'tutorial_19_exp_1': "Institutional investors are large organizations that invest on behalf of others. Examples include mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. They trade in very large volumes.",
    'tutorial_19_exp_2': "Retail investors are individuals, like you and me, who invest their own money for their personal accounts. Their trading volumes are much smaller.",
    'tutorial_19_ana_1': "It's the difference between a massive cargo ship and a small fishing boat. The cargo ship (institutional investor) is huge, moves a lot of goods (shares), and its movements can create large wakes that affect smaller vessels.",
    'tutorial_19_ana_2': "The fishing boat (retail investor) is much smaller and more agile but has far less impact on the overall sea conditions.",
    'tutorial_19_tak_1': "Institutional investors control the majority of the market's trading volume.",
    'tutorial_19_tak_2': "Retail investors are individuals investing for themselves.",
    'tutorial_19_tak_3': "The actions of institutional investors can significantly influence stock prices.",

    'tutorial_20_title': "Types of Stocks (Large-cap, Mid-cap, Small-cap)",

    'tutorial_24_ana_1': "Inflation is like a slow leak in your car's tires. Even if you're not driving, you're slowly losing air (value). Your investments need to grow faster than the leak to make progress.",

    'tutorial_1_title': "शेयर बाजार क्या है?",
    'tutorial_1_desc': "शेयर बाजार, उसके उद्देश्य और बुनियादी कार्यों का परिचय।",
    'tutorial_1_exp_1': "शेयर बाजार एक वैश्विक नेटवर्क है जहां लोग सार्वजनिक रूप से सूचीबद्ध कंपनियों में स्वामित्व हिस्सेदारी (शेयर या स्टॉक कहलाते हैं) खरीदते और बेचते हैं।",
    'tutorial_1_exp_2': "यह वह जगह है जहां व्यवसाय बढ़ने के लिए पैसा जुटाते हैं, और जहां निवेशक उन व्यवसायों के हिस्से-मालिक बनकर अपना पैसा बढ़ाने की कोशिश करते हैं।",
    'tutorial_1_ana_1': "इसे एक बहुत बड़े नीलामी घर की तरह सोचें। कंपनियां बिक्री के लिए अपने छोटे-छोटे टुकड़े रखती हैं। आप, एक निवेशक के रूप में, उन टुकड़ों पर बोली लगा सकते हैं।",
    'tutorial_1_ana_2': "यदि कंपनी अच्छा करती है, तो आपका टुकड़ा अधिक मूल्यवान हो जाता है, और आप इसे आपके द्वारा भुगतान किए गए से अधिक में बेच सकते हैं।",
    'tutorial_1_tak_1': "यह कंपनियों में स्वामित्व खरीदने और बेचने की जगह है।",
    'tutorial_1_tak_2': "कंपनियां विस्तार के लिए धन जुटाने के लिए इसका उपयोग करती हैं।",
    'tutorial_1_tak_3': "निवेशक इसका उपयोग संभावित रूप से अपनी संपत्ति बढ़ाने के लिए करते हैं।",
    
    'tutorial_2_title': "शेयर/स्टॉक क्या है?",
    'tutorial_2_desc': "समझें कि एक शेयर क्या दर्शाता है और एक शेयरधारक होने का क्या मतलब है।",
    'tutorial_2_exp_1': "एक शेयर, या स्टॉक, एक प्रमाण पत्र है जो एक कंपनी में स्वामित्व के एक छोटे से अंश का प्रतिनिधित्व करता है।",
    'tutorial_2_exp_2': "जब आप एक शेयर के मालिक होते हैं, तो आप एक 'शेयरधारक' होते हैं, और आपका कंपनी की संपत्ति और कमाई के एक हिस्से पर दावा होता है।",
    'tutorial_2_ana_1': "कल्पना कीजिए कि एक कंपनी एक बड़ा पिज्जा है। एक शेयर उस पिज्जा के एक स्लाइस की तरह है।",
    'tutorial_2_ana_2': "यदि आप एक स्लाइस के मालिक हैं, तो आप पिज्जा के हिस्से के मालिक हैं। यदि पिज्जा अधिक लोकप्रिय और मूल्यवान हो जाता है, तो आपका स्लाइस भी वैसा ही होता है।",
    'tutorial_2_tak_1': "एक शेयर एक कंपनी में स्वामित्व की एक इकाई है।",
    'tutorial_2_tak_2': "शेयरों का मालिक होना आपको एक हिस्सा-मालिक (एक शेयरधारक) बनाता है।",
    'tutorial_2_tak_3': "आपके शेयर का मूल्य कंपनी के प्रदर्शन के आधार पर बदल सकता है।",

    'tutorial_3_title': "कंपनियां शेयर क्यों जारी करती हैं?",
    'tutorial_3_desc': "उन प्राथमिक कारणों को जानें जिनकी वजह से व्यवसाय 'सार्वजनिक' होने और स्टॉक बेचने का विकल्प चुनते हैं।",
    'tutorial_3_exp_1': "कंपनियां मुख्य रूप से पैसा जुटाने के लिए शेयर जारी करती हैं, जिसे पूंजी भी कहा जाता है।",
    'tutorial_3_exp_2': "इस पैसे का उपयोग विभिन्न उद्देश्यों के लिए किया जा सकता है जैसे विस्तार का वित्तपोषण, नए उत्पादों को लॉन्च करना, ऋण चुकाना, या अधिक कर्मचारियों को काम पर रखना, बिना बैंक से ऋण लिए।",
    'tutorial_3_ana_1': "कल्पना कीजिए कि आपके पास एक नींबू पानी स्टैंड के लिए एक शानदार विचार है जिसे आप एक राष्ट्रव्यापी श्रृंखला में बदलना चाहते हैं। आपको नए स्टैंड बनाने के लिए बहुत सारे पैसे की आवश्यकता है।",
    'tutorial_3_ana_2': "उधार लेने के बजाय, आप अपने दोस्तों और परिवार को छोटे स्वामित्व वाले दांव बेचते हैं। वे आपको अभी पैसा देते हैं, इस उम्मीद में कि जैसे-जैसे आपका व्यवसाय बढ़ता है, उनका छोटा दांव बहुत अधिक मूल्यवान हो जाएगा।",
    'tutorial_3_tak_1': "मुख्य कारण विकास और संचालन के लिए पूंजी जुटाना है।",
    'tutorial_3_tak_2': "यह बैंक से पैसा उधार लेने का एक विकल्प है।",
    'tutorial_3_tak_3': "शेयर बेचना एक कंपनी को अपने जोखिम और संभावित मुनाफे दोनों को निवेशकों की एक विस्तृत श्रृंखला के साथ साझा करने की अनुमति देता है।",
